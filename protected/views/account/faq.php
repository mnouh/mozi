        <h3>How much does Mozi cost?</h3>
        <p>It is <u>free</u> to join and receive funds using Mozi. In peer-to-peer transactions, the sender is charged 2.9% plus $.30 per transaction. This cost is automatically
        calculated and deducted from your linked account. Users receiving payments are never charged for the transaction.</p>
        <h3>How safe is Mozi?</h3>
        <p>Mozi uses state-of-the-art and industry-standard 256-bit encryption processes to safeguard your account from unauthorized access. We monitor user accounts
            continuously for suspicious access or activity. Mozi automatically notifies users via e-mail and/or text message when a possible intrusion is detected.
            Mozi provides our users with the capability to freeze their account with one click, or by e-mail or phone. </p>
        <h3>What does Mozi do with my financial information?</h3>
        <p>Mozi takes all measures possible to protect the privacy and financial information of our users. All of our users information is stored in encrypted databases
            that are virtually impossible to access. User information is tightly restricted and controlled so that only Mozi and our trusted payment network has permission to access your account.
           </p>
           <h3> What does Mozi do with my private information?</h3>
           <p>We will never solicit your information or grant access to external parties. Mozi only uses your information for payment processing, account management, and identification 
               purposes. Mozi prides itself with putting user privacy first and foremost.</p>
           <h3>What account information can be seen by other users?</h3>
           <p>The only element of your account information that Mozi provides other users is your Mozi username. Other users will be unable to search for you by identifiers
               such as phone numbers, e-mail, and twitter handles. Other users, however, can send payments to your Mozi account using these other types of identifiers. At no
           point is your payment information (credit card number, bank account information, etc.) ever used for initiating payments by other users. </p>
